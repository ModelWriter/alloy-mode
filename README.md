# alloy-mode

This is an Emacs major mode that implements syntax hilighting and simple
indentation features for the [Alloy modeling language](http://alloytools.org/).
The original implementation was written by Allison Waingold and further
contributions were made by [psii](https://github.com/psii).

To use alloy-mode, simply download the file `alloy-mode.el` and place into your
[load-path](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath).
